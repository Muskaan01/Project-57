        <h2>READING BOOKS</h2>
        <hr id="hr">
        
        <p>I love reading books. I find it an interesting thing to do. Books have always caught my attraction. I admire reading them in my free time. I study in the seventh grade and have lots of books that are taught in school as well. I like any book to read, but my favourite is the Harry Potter series. Those seven books transfer me to a completely different world, a magical world. I feel that lovely sensation when I read a book. It flows through my whole body. And reading also has many advantages. It gives you knowledge and helps you stay aware of your surroundings. Reading books is not just my hobby or pastime, but its something that I get real joy when I do. I am really happy that my passion is reading and I will never get tired of it.</p>
